4) Ideas and facts cannot be copyrighted (but the way those are expressed can be)
5) Titles and short phrases are not protected under copyright

6)  Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp., the Ninth Circuit found that the reproduction of
thumbnails of plaintiff’s photographs in defendant’s search engine results was transformative,
noting that “[the search engine’s] use of the images serves a different function
than [plaintiff’s] use — improving access to information on the internet versus artistic expression.”

7) Minimally transformative, i.e. changing the intention of the original source

Best practices:

1. Reproduce only those portions of the headline or article that are necessary to make your point or to identify the story. Do not reproduce the story in its entirety.
2. Try not to use all, or even the majority, of articles available from a single source. Limit yourself to those articles that are directly relevant to your audience.
3. Prominently identify the source of the article.
4. Whenever possible, link to the original source of the article.
5. When possible, provide context or commentary for the material you use.
